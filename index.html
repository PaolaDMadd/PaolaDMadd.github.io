                        <p class="mapParagraph">Sometimes, after a long working day I like walk back home to regenerate my thoughts;
                          expecially when the weather is nice or the sunset dress up skyscrapers and the city became magical.
                          This is how <span style="strong"> #walkmehome </span> project started; for three months during Spring 2019, I shooted London's sunsets, dusks and skylines.
                          I discovered some of London's most impressive buildings in all their splendor. I was fascinated by the mix of modern architecture and the old industrial buildings.
                          Made in all sorts of shapes and colors and the line they drew in the sky.
                          On this map you can find their location. If you are interested on this project, you may visit my instagram @pao3671 </p>
